##lab-Getting started with App Engine

#Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following task

	-Initialize App Engine

	-Preview an App Engine application running locally in cloud shell

	-Deploy an App Engine Application, so others can reach it

	-Disable an App Engine Application when you no longer want it to be vissible

#Steps

1. Initialize App Engine
	
	#Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region with the following command
	gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

	#Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory with the following command
	git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

	#Navigate to the source directory with the command below
	cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

2. Run Hello World application locally 

	#Execute the following command to download and update the packages list.
	sudo apt-get update

	#Execute the following commands to set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual #environments are used to isolate package installations from the system
	sudo apt-get install virtualenv
	virtualenv -p python3 venv

	#Activate the virtual environment with the following command.
	source venv/bin/activate

	#Execute the following command to navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.
	pip install  -r requirements.txt

	#Run your application with the following command
	python main.py

3. Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine

	#Navigate to the source directory
	cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

	#Deploy your Hello World application
	gcloud app deploy

	#Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
	gcloud app browse

4. Disable the application

	#there is gcloud command to carryout this action
	#App Engine offers no option to Undeploy an application. After an application is deployed, it remains deployed
	#the app is disable from the console.
